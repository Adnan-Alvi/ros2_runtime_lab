# ros2_runtime_lab

Hands-on exploration of ROS 2 actions and executors to understand execution flow, concurrency, and real robot behavior.

---

## Why this repository

This repository is created to build a **deep understanding of ROS 2 runtime behavior** rather than just using ROS 2 APIs.

The focus is on:
- how actions are executed internally,
- how executors schedule callbacks,
- how concurrency is handled using callback groups,
- and how these concepts affect real robot systems.

Each example is intentionally small and focused, exploring **one runtime concept at a time**.

## Topics covered

- ROS 2 Action servers and clients  
- Goal lifecycle, feedback, result, and cancellation  
- Single-threaded vs multi-threaded executors  
- Callback groups and concurrency control
